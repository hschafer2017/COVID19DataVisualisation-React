## COVID-19 Data Visualisation of Live Data

A dashboard showing the impact of COVID 19 in different countries throughout the world. This dashboard is using [Nivo](https://nivo.rocks/), a React data visualisation library, and the [COVID 19 API](https://covid19api.com/) to display live, updated data on the cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases in various countries across the world. 

### Features 
- A Chloropleth heatmap showing the concentration of confirmed cases across the globe
- A stacked bar chart showing today's top 8 countries for new confirmed cases, including information on that country's death and recovery rate for today.
- A stacked bar chart showing the top 8 countries for total confirmed case count, including information on that country's total death and total recovery rate.

Upon choosing an individual country from the country dropdown, a user will see:
- A calendar heatmap showing the number of confirmed cases per day since January 2020 for the chosen country.
- A pie chart showing today's confirmed case count, death toll, and recovery numbers for the chosen country. 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
